            <h2>TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS TASK</h2>


            <p>This is where my reflection paragraph will go</p>
            <div class="TypeTask">

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/Axial-01.png">
                    <p>



                        By creating simple strokes across a paper and branching out lines of content from that stroke you have created an axial design.To make it even more interesting angle

                        the text, add shapes and strokes here and there,

                        or even stretch out some words. Finally, Axial design can be found all around us in nature such as

                        tree trunks branching out or flower leaves growing from a central stem.

                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/Dilatational-01.png">
                    <p>
                        Writing on a circular path that curls around a certain point creates dilatational design. we can highlight the importance of a piece of text by placing it in an obvious spot 

                        on these curved lines of content and giving it a larger font. Although it gets difficult to read as we add more text, Dilatational designs are certainly for more fun looking posters rather
                         
                        than long pieces of text.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/Bilateral-01.png">
                    <p>By centralizing all the text and them playing with it's position on the page we can achive the bilateral design. No matter how much we try to make all the text look symmetrical it won't work 

                        as words are not symmetrical so is nothing in nature. Leaving plenty of white space on your page can make it look sleek if done properly, so don't hesitate to do that. Chop your content, tilt it to the left         
                        
                        or right side of the page to make it visually pleasing.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img src="images/random-01.png">
                    <p>To create random design we can forget all the rules for a moment, and begin positioning the text where we please on the page. Playing with shapes and swirls we can create a theme to the poster. In random design it does not matter
                        if the content is readable or not as long as it conveys the messege of freedom in design. It's still important to make the most important text stand out somehow. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/Transitional-01.png">
                    <p>By writing your text in a more curved organic way you can achive transitional design.If angled to either side it can appear to be slipping out of the page.
                        this design reminds me of ocean waves especially when its more spaced out on the page. This type design is considered disorganized which is why it's not widely 
                        used in flyers or posters.
                    </p>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/Modular-01.png">
                    <p>Modular design can be achived by chosing a certain structure and repeating it. It would be most suitable to use content that is already cut up when designing a modular poster.
