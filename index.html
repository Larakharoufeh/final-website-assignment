            <h2>TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS TASK</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The Typography task was a very enjoyable task to complete as I got to learn about all the different type systems. It was the first task I started with for this course and I spent the most time on, as I had absolutely no idea 
                how to use illustrater. At first it took me 3 hours to complete one poster, then watching tutorials and practicing more helped me explore all the different tools, which resulted in changing the designs many times. As for the 
                8 typographic systems I found it less challenging to understand especially after the workshop session where we got to create our first design and every student got a different system to explain. In addition, I found inspiration 
                on Pintrest and on the internet that gave me a push to begin designing. Finally, I'm very happy with how my work turned out and I'm looking forward to learn more through this module.

                    <p>



                        By creating simple strokes across a paper and branching out lines of content from that stroke you have created an axial design.To make it even more interesting angle

                        the text, add shapes and strokes here and there,

                        or even stretch out some words. Finally, Axial design can be found all around us in nature such as

                        tree trunks branching out or flower leaves growing from a central stem.

                    <img  src="images/Dilatational-01.png">
                    <p>
                        Writing on a circular path that curls around a certain point creates dilatational design. we can highlight the importance of a piece of text by placing it in an obvious spot 

                        on these curved lines of content and giving it a larger font. Although it gets difficult to read as we add more text, Dilatational designs are certainly for more fun looking posters rather
                         
                        than long pieces of text.

                    <img  src="images/Bilateral-01.png">
                    <p>By centralizing all the text and them playing with it's position on the page we can achive the bilateral design. No matter how much we try to make all the text look symmetrical it won't work 

                        as words are not symmetrical so is nothing in nature. Leaving plenty of white space on your page can make it look sleek if done properly, so don't hesitate to do that. Chop your content, tilt it to the left         
                        
                        or right side of the page to make it visually pleasing.

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img src="images/random-01.png">
                    <p>To create random design we can forget all the rules for a moment, and begin positioning the text where we please on the page. Playing with shapes and swirls we can create a theme to the poster. In random design it does not matter
                        if the content is readable or not as long as it conveys the messege of freedom in design. It's still important to make the most relevent text stand out somehow. </p>

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/Transitional-01.png">
                    <p>By writing your text in a more curved organic way you can achive transitional design.If angled to either side it can appear to be slipping out of the page.
                        this design reminds me of ocean waves especially when its more spaced out on the page. This type design is considered disorganized which is why it's not widely 
                        used in flyers or posters.

                    <img  src="images/Modular-01.png">
                    <p>Modular design can be achived by chosing a certain structure and repeating it across the page. It would be most suitable to use content that is already cut up when designing a modular poster.By displaying it 
                        in circles like I did above or using squares sometimes modular design can be mistaken for something else such as grid design. Therefore, its important to know that this design is all about repeating structure.

                <div class="type-container">
                    <img  src="images/grid-01.png">
                    <p>To create grid design the content has to be lined up into rows and columns. This typogeaphic design is a more boring one as all the text is lined neatly unlike the other designs where the text is wrapped around
                        a cirlce or runs across the page.This text style works in books,posters,flyers it's the most common type in books as it displays the content in paraghraphs that can be esily read, and the writer has the freedom 
                        to display a photo right next to the paragraph as it would easily show that the photo and paragraph are connected.

                    <img  src="images/Radial-01.png">
                    <p>To create a radial design we must have a central point with all the content radiating out from that point.Just like how a kid would draw the sun with so many lines surrounding the main circle wich is our central point.
                        Although, the easiest way to explain this design is is to use the example of the sun radial design does not have to come in a form of a circle these lines can radiate from a square or a triangle.We can group the 
                        relevent information together to make the content more understandable.

            <h2>Contrast. Alignment. Repetiton. Proximity.</h2>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p>
                The CARP task was the second task I worked on, I noticed it had more creative freedom as we could use more than one color and any font of our choice. Contrast,Alignment,Repetiton,Proximity are the elements we had to include in this task 
                to design 3 posters for a non-profit film festival. Although, we had the freedom to include photos from the internet I chose to challenge myself and try to make my posters pretty without adding photos.It was crucial for this task to identify the most important
                text in a strategic place as it would be the first anyone looking at the posters would read. Contrasting can be achived either by using diffferent colors or by making an item much smaller or larger than the ones close to it. On the other hand, Alignment can either 
                be achived through text or objects on the poster. Aligning the text horizintally like I did in my first poster gives a sense that these paragraphs are related or connected in a way. Similarly, repetition has the same effect of making every element on the page feel related
                by repeating a certain design, color, or font across the poster you can achive unitly through design as evrything will look related. Finally, Proximity groups similar items closer together and seperates unrelated items away from each other.
